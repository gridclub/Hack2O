## <a name="dataset"></a> Details

At this year’s annual hackathon, we will be exploring water contamination data, especially as it relates to lead contamination in **Flint, MI**. We will have additional data for waterborne disease outbreaks and other water-related health statistics.

Participants will be competing in teams to:
* design a project question
* import and clean data
* build a model to answer their project question
* use data visualization to explain their results
* present to a panel of judges and peers.

Check back soon for a complete description of data and objectives.
