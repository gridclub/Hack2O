The [Graduate Researchers in Data](http://www.gridclub.io) (GRiD) club at [UMass Amherst](http://www.umass.edu) is hosting our annual ***Data Science Hackathon***! For 2017, we’ll be exploring water contamination datasets, especially as it relates to lead contamination in **Flint, MI**. This year we’re happy to be co-organizing this event with Nabanita De of [Microsoft Student Partner](https://www.facebook.com/groups/198842233863002/).

The competition is open to all graduate students. Prizes will be given to the winners, generously sponsored by [AmherstWorks](https://amherstworks.io/) and Microsoft Student Partner.

## <a name="dataset"></a> Details

At this year’s annual hackathon, we will be exploring water contamination data, especially as it relates to [lead contamination in **Flint, MI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis). We will have additional data for waterborne disease outbreaks and other water-related health statistics.

Participants will be competing in teams to:
* design a project question
* import and analyse data
* build a model to answer their project question
* use data visualization to explain their results
* present to a panel of judges and peers.

The dataset, along with detailed instructions, will be released together with the hackathon kick-off.

## <a name="faq"></a> FAQ

- *Are teams outside UMass allowed?*
    + ALL teams are welcome, although we are focused primarily on graduate students from the Five Colleges. Unfortunately, at this time, we cannot provide accomodations or travel reimbursements for out-of-town teams. We apologise for the inconvenience.

- *How large can teams be?*
    + We expect teams of maximum size 3. 
    
- *What if I can't find enough team members?* 
    + There will be a team formation session. It is a great opportunity to meet and work with new people and throw around interesting ideas.

- *Are we expected to stick around all day?*
    + The hackathon space is available for the entire weekend, along with organizers being present for technical support. It is totally fine to get hacking from home or wherever - just turn up in person for the final decisions on Sunday.

- *There will be food, right?* 
    + Meals will be provided throughout the weekend, including dinner on Friday, breakfast/lunch/dinner on Saturday, and breakfast/lunch on Sunday.   

- *What if I am just starting out with data science or hackathons?*
    + Registration is open to ***any*** graduate student from the Five Colleges, regardless of experience with data science. Undergraduates may compete by invitation (please mail us if you have doubts).
